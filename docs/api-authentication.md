# API Authentication for VisionCraft MCP Server

This document outlines the planned authentication system for the VisionCraft MCP Server.

## Current Implementation

The current version supports passing an API key via:

1. Command line: `--api-key YOUR_API_KEY`
2. Configuration file: `{ "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY" }`

The API key is included in the `X-API-Key` header when making requests to the VisionCraft RAG endpoint.

## Future Authentication Plans

### API Key Generation

We plan to implement a key generation system where:

1. Users register on the VisionCraft website
2. After payment/subscription, they receive a unique API key
3. The key grants access to premium features and higher rate limits

### Implementation Details

The authentication system will include:

- **Key Validation**: Server-side validation of API keys
- **Usage Tiers**: Different access levels based on subscription
- **Rate Limiting**: Request limits based on tier
- **Analytics**: Track usage patterns for optimization

### Security Considerations

- Keys will be transmitted securely using HTTPS
- Keys should never be hardcoded in client applications
- Users should store keys in environment variables or secure configuration files
- We will implement key rotation policies for enhanced security

## Integration with MCP

The authentication system will be transparent to Claude and other MCP clients. The MCP server will handle all authentication details, allowing Claude to focus on providing accurate computer vision information.

## Recommended Practices

For developers integrating VisionCraft MCP:

1. Store API keys in environment variables
2. Don't commit API keys to version control
3. Use the configuration file approach for easier key management
4. Consider implementing a secure key storage solution in production environments
