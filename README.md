## ‚ùå Without VisionCraft MCP

AI assistants struggle with computer vision and Gen-AI knowledge:

- ‚ùå Limited understanding of cutting-edge computer vision algorithms
- ‚ùå Outdated information on models released after training cutoff
- ‚ùå Generic answers that lack depth and technical accuracy
- ‚ùå No awareness of latest frameworks and tools

## ‚úÖ With VisionCraft MCP

VisionCraft MCP delivers up-to-date, specialized computer vision and Gen-AI knowledge directly to Claude and other AI assistants.

Add `use visioncraft` to your prompt in Claude:

```txt
Explain how YOLOv12 differs from previous versions. use visioncraft
```

```txt
What are the best approaches for real-time 3D object detection? use visioncraft
```
